Lightning is one of the mundane-looking natural phenomena, frequently encountered on cloudy days. It is an electrostatic discharge from atmosphere to ground. But it is a catastrophic form of high potential. It not only poses a threat to living beings but also causes damage to buildings, towers, fields and also causes shock waves. Moreover, even though we live amidst the tech age, surviving a high-tech livelihood, there is scarcity of power supply. We still come across shortages of electricity in our daily lives. So, in order to get rid of this problem, we came up with an idea of extraction of electrical energy from lightning. This idea not only makes us get rid of this power crisis but also suppress the threats posed by lightning. A lightning strike consists of an enormous amount of electric potential (about 1 billion volts).The idea is to design a machine that can capture lightning and convert it into electricity that can be utilised by us. Through this, we can supply power to a locality for several days. The following documentation demonstrates the research and process involved in this area of issue.
